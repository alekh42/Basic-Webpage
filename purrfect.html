				What is Model UN and how do I sign up?

				Model United Nations is an academic simulation of the United Nations where students play the role of delegates from different countries and attempt to solve real world issues with the policies and perspectives of their assigned country. For example, a student may be assigned the United Kingdom and will have to solve global topics such as nuclear non-proliferation or climate change from the policies and perspectives of the United Kingdom.

				Students can attend Model United Nations conferences around the world. These conferences are organized by universities, high schools, non-profit organizations, and other educational groups. Conferences are offered for different academic levels: college and university, high school, middle school, and grade school. There is no central governing body for Model UN — any school can create a Model UN team and register for any Model UN conference they wish to attend.

				Once a team has registered for a conference, it receives a country to represent. Each student on that team will represent that country in a different committee with different topics. For example, Best Delegate High School could be assigned China and have different students representing China in the disarmament committee, the human rights committee, the development committee, and so forth. Schools with larger teams will receive additional countries.

				<p>

				When you or your club are first getting started with MUN, you need to select a conference to attend. Visit our MUN Conferences page to find a conference to attend. The largest conferences are 4-day events at a hotel with 3,000+ delegates and more than 300 delegates in the same committee, but when you’re first starting out, we suggest finding a small 1-day or 2-day novice conference near you so it’s easier to learn how MUN works.
				How do I prepare for my first conference?

				Once you have signed up for a conference, you will receive your country assignment, your committee, and its topics. Most conferences provide a Background Guide or Topic Synopsis that introduces the topics — read that first.

				There are typically three items to prepare before you walk into your first conference: the Position Paper (sometimes called a Policy Statement), your Opening Speech, and a Research Binder. Some novice conferences may also require a Country Profile.

				1. Position Paper (or Policy Statement)

				The Position Paper is a one or two page document that is essentially a summary of your knowledge of the topic and the position your country plans to take when it enters committee. It typically contains four sections: Background of Topic, Past International Actions, Country Policy, and Possible Solutions. Position Papers are usually due before the conference.

				The key starting points for researching each section are listed below. They will help you get started with participating in your first Model UN conference, but you will want to dig deeper as you develop more experience.

				Model United Nations, also known as Model UN or MUN, is an extra-curricular activity in which students typically roleplay delegates to the United Nations and simulate UN committees. This activity takes place at MUN conferences, which is usually organized by a high school or college MUN club. At the end of most conferences, outstanding delegates in each committee are recognized and given an award certificate; the Best Delegate in each committee, however, receives a gavel.

				Thousands of middle school, high school, and college students across the country and around the world participate in Model United Nations, which involves substantial researching, public speaking, debating, and writing skills, as well as critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities.

				For example, my senior year of high school, I attended the 2004 National High School MUN Conference (NHSMUN), held at the Hilton Towers Hotel in New York City. My friend, Shebli, and I co-represented the Syrian Arab Republic on the United Nations Security Council. Students from other high schools such as Stuyvesant High School, Horace Mann School, and University of Chicago Preparatory School represented the United States, China, and the other member states of the Security Council. For four days, we debated the security situation in the Republic of Georgia.

				Every student gave speeches detailing their country’s position on the topic and offering possible solutions. Our chair, Dave, moderated our debate; he was a student from the University of Pennsylvania. By day 4, we had written a resolution, a document that described the Security Council’s stance on the situation in Georgia and the actions that the committee had resolved to take. The committee voted in favor of adopting the resolution. At the end of the conference, Dave recognized Shebli’s and my leadership in committee by awarding us the Best Delegate award.

				Part of what makes Model UN great, though, is that it is rapidly re-inventing itself. Today, many MUN conferences hold simulations that are not UN committees. In addition to simulations of the Security Council and General Assembly, many conferences are running simulations of the US National Security Council, where delegates represent President Bush and Condoleezza Rice. Many conferences feature a Joint Cabinet Crisis, where two or more committees of delegates are linked together, and the actions taken in one committee affect the other.

				For example, my college’s conference, the Security Council Simulation at Yale (SCSY), held a simulation of the Korean War, where delegates role-played the ministers of the American, Soviet, and Chinese cabinets in 1950. Princeton’s college conference has taken this idea to an entirely new level; every committee at their conference is part of the same Joint Cabinet Crisis.
